# YOURLS

> [YOURLS](https://yourls.org/) is a set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run Your Own URL Shortener.

## About

This chart installs the [YOURLS](https://yourls.org) app on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster
using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It includes the [MariaDB chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mariadb) which is required for
bootstrapping a MariaDB deployment for the database requirements of the YOURLS application.

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes [1.23+](https://kubernetes.io/releases/)
* [Persistant Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Usage

This chart expects to be manage as a standard [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/).
All the commands from the [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/) apply.

```console
helm install my-release yourls/yourls
```

_See [the official Helm CLI documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/) for commands description._

## Configuration

See [Customizing the Chart Before Installing](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
To see all configurable options with detailed comments:

```console
helm show values yourls/yourls
```

Values definition are also available in the [`values.schema.json`](values.schema.json) file.

### YOURLS

The `yourls` parameters map to the env variables defined in [YOURLS](https://hub.docker.com/_/yourls).

_For more information please refer to the [YOURLS](https://hub.docker.com/_/yourls) image documentation._

### MariaDB

The `mariadb` parameters map to [MariaDB sub-chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mariadb) parameters.

_For more information please refer to the [MariaDB parameters](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mariadb#parameters) documentation._

## Persistence

The [YOURLS](https://hub.docker.com/_/yourls) image stores the YOURLS data and configurations at the `/yourls` path of the container.

## Using an external database

Sometimes you may want to have YOURLS connect to an external database rather than installing one inside your cluster, e.g.
to use a managed database service, or use run a single database server for all your applications.

To do this, the chart allows you to specify credentials for an external database under the `externalDatabase` parameter.
You should also disable the MariaDB installation with the `mariadb.enabled` option. For example:

```console
helm install yourls/yourls \
  --set mariadb.enabled=false,externalDatabase.host=myexternalhost,externalDatabase.user=myuser,externalDatabase.password=mypassword,externalDatabase.database=mydatabase
```

Note also if you disable MariaDB per above you MUST supply values for the `externalDatabase` connection.

## Ingress

This chart provides support for ingress resources. If you have an
ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/nginx/nginx-ingress)
or [traefik](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/traefik/traefik) you can utilize
the ingress controller to serve your YOURLS application.

To enable ingress integration, please set `ingress.enabled` to `true`

### Hosts

Most likely you will only want to have one hostname that maps to this
YOURLS installation, however, it is possible to have more than one
host.  To facilitate this, the `ingress.hosts` object is an array.

For each item, please indicate a `name`, `tls`, `tlsSecret`, and any
`annotations` that you may want the ingress controller to know about. You will
also need `path` and `pathType`, for which you can see [the Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types)
for more information.

Indicating TLS will cause YOURLS to generate HTTPS URLs, and
YOURLS will be connected to at port 443.  The actual secret that
`tlsSecret` references do not have to be generated by this chart.
However, please note that if TLS is enabled, the ingress record will not
work until this secret exists.
